# JSTerminal - Very basic javascript terminal

### Why?
I've created this just for fun.

### Usage
Just display the index.html in a recent browser like chrome.
This project currently does not support old browsers and might not work on other browsers.
It has only been tested on chrome.

Either download this repo or use [the Github Page](https://justlunix.github.io/js-terminal/).
